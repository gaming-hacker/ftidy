TIDY version 7.2, 1999-10-15

Function:
TIDY 7.2 is a highly configurable FORTRAN program to indent and
renumber statements, selectively change case of keywords or
non-keywords, and do various other clean-up tasks on FORTRAN-77
source programs. TIDY can convert some FORTRAN-66 features such as
Hollerith constants to FORTRAN-77. TIDY can either retain DO/END DO
loops or convert them to standard FORTRAN-77 loops. It can change
comment specifiers from C,c,or * to ! as in F90 style. Supports F90
CYCLE, EXIT, DO WHILE loops, IMPLICIT NONE, INCLUDE  statements,  
long variable names, the relational operators <,>,<=,>=,
==,/= and the use of underscores in variable names. 

Installation: 
Just put tidy.exe in a directory in your path.

Usage: 
tidy fname.ext
where fname.ext is the source file containing the FORTRAN code to be
cleaned up. If .ext is omitted in the invocation, then the source is looked
for in fname.for and fname.f in that order. The tidied program is put in
fname.tid and the listing including error messages in fname.lis. Many
formatting options for TIDY can be set in an initialization file. TIDY
looks for an initialization file tidy.ini in the current directory. If
tidy.ini is not found, then it is assumed that there is no control file.

==========================================================================
What's new?

*Version 7.2 (1999-10-15)
Added support for the F90 statements: implicit none, cycle and exit.

Source code modified to reduce non-standard F77 usage to calls to 
Exit and GetArg. The code can now be compiled with Lahey F77L, LF90, LF95 
and GNU g77.

Archaic features such as carriage control, specific intrinsic function
calls, and arithmetic IF statements have been eliminated from the
source code.
 
Minor bug fix.

*Version 7.01 (1998-06-12)
Lines with ! in column 1 are treated as comments.
Some defaults have been changed to reflect a transition to F90 coding
style. The default *ENDO option changes comments to start with a !.

Another change is the invocation of TIDY and opening of files. On an
MS-DOS system, TIDY 7.01 is run by the command
                     tidy fname.ext
If an extension has been specified, then the source is assumed to be in
'fname.ext' where 'ext' may be blank. If there there is no '.ext' part,
then TIDY 7.01 looks for the source first in 'fname.for' and then in
'fname.f'. If none of these is found, then the program terminates. If the
source file is located, then the 'listing' file is named 'fname.lis' and
the 'punch' file is named 'fname.tid'.

TIDY 7.01 looks for a control file named 'tidy.ini' in the current
directory. If it is not found, then it is assumed that there is no control
file.
