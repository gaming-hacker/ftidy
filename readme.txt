Description

This program has a long history of usefulness. In its original form, it
served to renumber the statements of a Fortran program after it had
been modified several times and become hard to read. Other features were
added over time, such as indenting DO loops and IF blocks, changing case, 
and converting Hollerith strings to quote delimited strings. The original 
author was Harry Murphy of the USAF weapons lab at Kirtland. It has passed 
to several different caretakers over the years. I remember that we cared for
it and made a few mods at NASA Ames. Alice Barlow was our programmer in 
charge. Now, it is under the auspices of

The program is here for your convenience, but you will want to bookmark
the web site above so you have ready access to the latest version from the
current maintainer. A Macintosh version is available from the web site.

This is certainly a classic case of an open source program that has 
benefitted countless programmers. And our thanks to Prof. Thakkar for
keeping this valuable program alive.
